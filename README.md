# Fuel-Consumption-2000---2022-EDA
A repository Of EDA project
## Introducton
* The dataset gives information about the fuel consumption of 2000-2022 model year light-duty vehicles of Canada country. People can use this information to compare vehicles as they shop for the most fuel-efficient vehicle that meets their everyday needs.
* If people shop that fuel is an expense will be paying for a long time. If they buy a fuel-efficient vehicle, drive it in fuel-efficient ways and follow the manufacturer’s maintenance recommendations, They'll save money for years to come – even more if fuel prices rise.
## Objective:
* To find out which car brands and models emitting more CO2 emissions and which brands of cars emit less co2 emissions by exploratory data analysis.After interpreting the results, it help people to buy light duty vehicles which is fuel efficient and emits less Co2.
## Tools:
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn
## Conclusion:
* EDA enables People with valuable and analytical insights, especially determining Which make and model of car to buy which is fuel efficient and less Co2 emissions.
